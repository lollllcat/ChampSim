  <p> ChampSim is a trace-based simulator for a microarchitecture study. You can sign up to the public mailing list by sending an empty mail to champsim+subscribe@googlegroups.com. Traces for the 3rd Data Prefetching Championship (DPC-3) can be found from here (https://dpc3.compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/?SW_IS). A set of traces used for the 2nd Cache Replacement Championship (CRC-2) can be found from this link. (http://bit.ly/2t2nkUj) <p>

# Prerequisite
**Install PIN**
Decompress the PIN version 3.11. The version that supported by ChampSim in the original document (version 3.2)does not support the latest kernel any more.
```
tar -zxvf pin-3.11-97998-g7ecce2dac-gcc-linux.tar.gz
```

**Change the path of the trace collecting script**
In `tracer/run_tracer.sh`, there are several variable that need to be changed in order to run the script on your own machine.
```
${PIN_SOURCE}:  The path to the PIN binary                                   
${BENCH_BIN}:   The path to the binary of all benchmarks that will be instrumented                       
${TRACE_DIR}:   The path that the trace file will located.
```

In `tracer/make_tracer.sh`, change the first line to the path that your PIN binary located.
```
export PIN_ROOT=PATH_TO_YOUR_PIN_BINARY
```

In `run_champsim.sh`, change the default trace file, default one is `$PWD/dpc3_traces` 
```
TRACE_DIR=PATH_TO_YOUR_TRACE_FILE # should be equal to the ${TRACE_DIR}
```


# Clone ChampSim repository
```
git clone https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim.git
```

# Compile

ChampSim takes five parameters: Branch predictor, L1D prefetcher, L2C prefetcher, LLC replacement policy, and the number of cores. 
For example, `./build_champsim.sh bimodal no no lru 1` builds a single-core processor with bimodal branch predictor, no L1/L2 data prefetchers, and the baseline LRU replacement policy for the LLC.
```
$ ./build_champsim.sh bimodal no no no lru 1

$ ./build_champsim.sh ${BRANCH} ${L1D_PREFETCHER} ${L2C_PREFETCHER} ${LLC_PREFETCHER} ${LLC_REPLACEMENT} ${NUM_CORE}
```

# Run simulation

Execute `run_champsim.sh` with proper input arguments. The default `TRACE_DIR` in `run_champsim.sh` is set to `$PWD/dpc3_traces`. <br>

* Single-core simulation: Run simulation with `run_champsim.sh` script. <b>NOTE that the N_WARM and N_SIM here should be the full number, not just the number of millions, i.e., if you'd like to do warmup with 1 million instructions, please give the input 1000000, not 1</b>

```
Usage: ./run_champsim.sh [BINARY] [N_WARM] [N_SIM] [TRACE] [OPTION]
$ ./run_champsim.sh bimodal-no-no-no-lru-1core 1 10 400.perlbench-41B.champsimtrace.xz

${BINARY}: ChampSim binary compiled by "build_champsim.sh" (bimodal-no-no-lru-1core)
${N_WARM}: number of instructions for warmup (1 million)
${N_SIM}:  number of instructinos for detailed simulation (10 million)
${TRACE}: trace name (400.perlbench-41B.champsimtrace.xz)
${OPTION}: extra option for "-low_bandwidth" (src/main.cc)
```
Simulation results will be stored under "results_${N_SIM}M" as a form of "${TRACE}-${BINARY}-${OPTION}.txt".<br> 

* Multi-core simulation: Run simulation with `run_4core.sh` script. <br>
```
Usage: ./run_4core.sh [BINARY] [N_WARM] [N_SIM] [N_MIX] [TRACE0] [TRACE1] [TRACE2] [TRACE3] [OPTION]
$ ./run_4core.sh bimodal-no-no-no-lru-4core 1 10 0 400.perlbench-41B.champsimtrace.xz \\
  401.bzip2-38B.champsimtrace.xz 403.gcc-17B.champsimtrace.xz 410.bwaves-945B.champsimtrace.xz
```
Note that we need to specify multiple trace files for `run_4core.sh`. `N_MIX` is used to represent a unique ID for mixed multi-programmed workloads. 


# Add your own branch predictor, data prefetchers, and replacement policy (For Hawkeye, this step can be ignored)
**Copy an empty template**
```
$ cp branch/branch_predictor.cc prefetcher/mybranch.bpred
$ cp prefetcher/l1d_prefetcher.cc prefetcher/mypref.l1d_pref
$ cp prefetcher/l2c_prefetcher.cc prefetcher/mypref.l2c_pref
$ cp prefetcher/llc_prefetcher.cc prefetcher/mypref.llc_pref
$ cp replacement/llc_replacement.cc replacement/myrepl.llc_repl
```

**Work on your algorithms with your favorite text editor**
```
$ vim branch/mybranch.bpred
$ vim prefetcher/mypref.l1d_pref
$ vim prefetcher/mypref.l2c_pref
$ vim prefetcher/mypref.llc_pref
$ vim replacement/myrepl.llc_repl
```

**Compile and test**
```
$ ./build_champsim.sh mybranch mypref mypref mypref myrepl 1
$ ./run_champsim.sh mybranch-mypref-mypref-mypref-myrepl-1core 1 10 bzip2_183B
```

# How to create traces

**Use the Pin tool like this**
```
pin -t obj-intel64/champsim_tracer.so -- <your program here>
```

The tracer has three options you can set:
```
-o
Specify the output file for your trace.
The default is default_trace.champsim

-s <number>
Specify the number of instructions to skip in the program before tracing begins.
The default value is 0.

-t <number>
The number of instructions to trace, after -s instructions have been skipped.
The default value is 1,000,000.
```
For example, you could trace 200,000 instructions of the program ls, after
skipping the first 100,000 instructions, with this command:
```
pin -t obj/champsim_tracer.so -o traces/ls_trace.champsim -s 100000 -t 200000 -- ls
```
Traces created with the champsim_tracer.so are approximately 64 bytes per instruction,
but they generally compress down to less than a byte per instruction using xz compression.
**Use scripts**
```
# under tracer/
./run_tracer ${BENCHMARK_NAME} ${INSTR_TO_IGNORE} ${INSTR_TO_TRACE} 

# For example
./run_tracer 2mm 1000000 10000000
```

We provide the `instruction_count.csv` under `tracer` directory. It contains the number of dynamic instructions for kernels for each polyhedral benchamrk.
Here is an example:
```
(benchmark), (instr_num to ignre), (total_instr_num), (kernel_instr_num)
2mm,2079427,288675485,286596058
```

# Evaluate Simulation

ChampSim measures the IPC (Instruction Per Cycle) value as a performance metric. <br>
There are some other useful metrics printed out at the end of simulation. <br>

Good luck and be a champion! <br>
